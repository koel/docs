# What is Koel Plus?

## Introduction

Koel Plus is the premium version of Koel. It offers additional features and enhancements on top of the Community edition, including but not limited to:
 
- **Multi-library Support**: In Koel Plus, each user has their own library, which they populate by uploading their own music.
- **Music Sharing**: By default, uploaded music is private to the user who uploaded it. However, users can choose to share their music with others by marking songs as public.
- **Collaboration**: Users can invite others to [collaborate](./collaboration) on their playlists, allowing them to add, remove, and reorder songs.
- **Cloud Storage Support**: In addition to local storage, Koel Plus supports cloud storage services like Amazon S3 (or any S3-compatible service) and Dropbox. See [Storage Support](./storage-support) for more information.

Other features are being planned or actively developed, for example:

- **SSO**: Users can log into Koel using their existing credentials from another service like Google or Facebook.
- **Authorization via Proxy-Authorization Header**: Authorize users via a proxy server, allowing Koel to be used in a corporate environment.
- **Refined Roles & Permissions**: Create custom roles and assign them to users, controlling what they can and cannot do.
- **Custom Themes**: Allow users to customize the look and feel of Koel in addition to the built-in themes.

## Do you need Koel Plus?
Since Koel Plus's flagship feature is multi-library support, it's most useful in a multi-user environment, such as a family or a small organization. 
If you're a single user, you might not need Koel Plus.

However, if you want to host your media files on a cloud storage service like Amazon S3 or Dropbox, you'll need Koel Plus. 
Purchasing Koel Plus is also a good way to support the active development of Koel.
