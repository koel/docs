# Artist, Album, and Playlist Arts

If [integrated](../service-integrations) with Spotify, Koel will attempt to fetch artists' images and album arts from Spotify
whenever a song is played. 

You can upload custom images for artists, albums, and playlists. 
To do so, drag and drop an image file onto the artist, album, or playlist thumbnail.

If there is no available for artist and album, Koel will use a default image (the Koel bird logo). 
For a playlist, a random "thumbnail stack" will be generated and used based on the content.
